## Analysis & Design

## Obstacles
#### Problem 1
Due to programming in Python, the application is large, since the language used is dynamically typed. Additionally, Pyinstaller, an extension of Python used to convert python files into executables, packs a lot of libaries into the application. Thus, the application is quite large in total memory. While it was certaintly easier and faster to write the application, execution is expected to be slower due to Python's dynamic typeset nature; albeit, it's marginal in my purpose.
> Solution : I would write the application in a statically typed language like C or Java to keep the application as low weight as possible.
